Questions for Assignment3


Question 1: Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000


Question 2: Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write five different expressions that: i) add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd 2) strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s) 3) acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array 4) acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array 5) takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn

Question 3: A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph (write your own paragraph to check), and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt


Question 4: Using reduce functions: 1) add only even numbers in a list 2) find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters) adds every 3rd number in a list

Question 5: Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999

Question 6: Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided.
